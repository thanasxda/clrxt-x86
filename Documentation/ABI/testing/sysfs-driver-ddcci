Description:	This file provides the user interface for the
		master device on the I2C bus. It exports the following
		peices of information:

		- idProt

		ACCESS.bus protocol supported by the device. Usually
		"monitor".

		- idType

		ACCESS.bus device subtype. Usually "LCD" or "CRT".

		- idModel

		ACCESS.bus device model identifier. Usually a
		shortened form of the device model name.

		- idVendor

		ACCESS.bus device vendor identifier. Empty if the
		Identification command is not supported.

		- idModule

		ACCESS.bus device module identifier. Empty if the
		Identification command is not supported.

		- idSerial

		32 bit device number. A fixed serial number if it's
		positive, a temporary serial number if negative and zero
		if the Identification command is not supported.

		- modalias

		A combined identifier for driver selection. It has the form:
		ddcci:<idProt>-<idType>-<idModel>-<idVendor>-<idModule>.
		All non-alphanumeric characters (including whitespace)
		in the model, vendor or module parts are replaced by
		underscores to prevent issues with software like systemd-udevd.
